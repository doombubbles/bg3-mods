# Doombubbles Difficulty Mod

## Experimental Changes

These changes are less set in stone and may be turned on/off periodicaly

### Initiative D12 (Currently OFF)

Initiative die is now a D12

### Potion Sickness (Currently ON)

After being healed by a health potion, you must take a Short or Long Rest before you can be healed again by one.

Explanation: This is an experiment aimed at changing the incentives around "Potion Baths" outside of combat being so strong that they significantly change the rate at which rests are needed.

## Main Changes

### Tavern Brawler
- Now uses your Proficiency Bonus instead of your Strength modifier

### Arcane Acuity
- Stacks capped at 5 instead of 10

### Radiating Orb
- Stacks capped at 5 instead of 10

### Slashing Flourish

<!-- - Slashing Flourish now deals half base weapon damage like most other cleave effects -->
- Ranged Slashing Flourish now must target 2 different entities

### Wild Shape: Earth Myrmidon

- Tavern Brawler no longer double dips its damage bonuses
- Now deals 1d10 Thunder damage, in line with the tooltip and the other myrmidon wild shape forms

### Vulnerability

Many conditions which previously applied lasting Vulnerability for a damage type will instead now just remove any Resistance to the damage type
- Wet
- Steeped in Bliss
- Aura of Murder (version from Bhaalist Armour and Bloodthirst)
- Chilled
- Brittle

Explanation: I've found that these vulnerability appliers warp the meta for burst damage builds too much for my tastes, so this change leaves them still relevant as a way to bypass Resistance like Elemental Adept.

### Scrolls

Randomized scroll loot will no longer include scrolls above a level that a full spellcaster at your party's level could cast
